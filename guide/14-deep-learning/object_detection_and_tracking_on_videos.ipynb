This function applies the model to each frame of the video, and provides the classes and bounding boxes of detected objects in each frame. The information is stored in a metadata file. The detected objects can also be visualized on the video, by specifying the `visualize=True` flag. By default, the output video is saved in the original video's directory.\n",

This function updates the CSV file by encoding object detections in the MISB 0903 standard in the `vmtilocaldataset` column. When multiplexed with the original video, this enables the object detections to be visualized in ArcGIS Pro, using its support for Full Motion Video (FMV) and VMTI (video moving target indications) metadata.
