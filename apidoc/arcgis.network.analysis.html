<dd><p>This ArcGIS Online service solves a vehicle routing problem (VRP) to find the best routes for a
fleet of vehicles. It is similar to <cite>solve_vehicle_routing_problem</cite>, but <cite>edit_vehicle_routing_problem</cite>
is designed to make a few, small edits to the results of a VRP and re-solve or solve a small VRP
analysis of only two routes.</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>

<tbody>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><strong>Argument</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Description</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>orders</p></td>
<td><p>Required FeatureSet. Specify one or more orders (up to 2,000).
These are the locations that the routes of the vehicle routing
problem (VRP) analysis should visit. An order can represent a
delivery (for example, furniture delivery), a pickup (such as an
airport shuttle bus picking up a passenger), or some type of service
or inspection (a tree trimming job or building inspection, for
instance).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>depots</p></td>
<td><p>Required FeatureSet. These represent the location where the routes
will start and end at for the routes.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>routes</p></td>
<td><p>Required FeatureSet. Specify one or more routes (up to 100). A route
specifies vehicle and driver characteristics; after solving, it also
represents the path between depots and orders.</p>
<p>A route can have start and end depot service times, a fixed or
flexible starting time, time-based operating costs, distance-based
operating costs, multiple capacities, various constraints on a
driver’s workday, and so on. When specifying the routes, you can set
properties for each one by using attributes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>breaks</p></td>
<td><p>Optional FeatureSet. These are the rest periods, or breaks, for the
routes in a given vehicle routing problem. A break is associated with
exactly one route, and it can be taken after completing an order,
while en-route to an order, or prior to servicing an order. It has a
start time and a duration, for which the driver may or may not be
paid.
There are three options for establishing when a break begins: using
a time window, a maximum travel time, or a maximum work time.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>time_units</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. The time units for all time-based field values in
the analysis.  Allowed values: <cite>Seconds</cite>, <cite>Minutes</cite>, <cite>Hours</cite>, or <cite>Days</cite></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>distance_units</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. The distance units for all distance-based field
values in the analysis. Allowed values: <cite>Meters</cite>,`Kilometers`,`Feet`,`Yards`,`Miles`,`NauticalMiles`</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>analysis_region</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Specify the region in which to perform the analysis.
If a value is not specified for this parameter, the tool will
automatically calculate the region name based on the location of the
input points.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>default_date</p></td>
<td><p>Optional Datetime. The default date for time field values that
specify a time of day without including a date.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>uturn_policy</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Use this parameter to restrict or permit the service
area to make U-turns at junctions.</p>
<p>The parameter can have the following values:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><cite>ALLOW_UTURNS-U</cite> - turns are permitted everywhere. Allowing
U-turns implies that the vehicle can turn around at any junction and
double back on the same street. This is the default value.</p></li>
<li><p><cite>NO_UTURNS-U</cite> - turns are prohibited at all junctions: pseudo-junctions, intersections, and dead-ends.
Note, however, that U-turns may be permitted even when this option is chosen.</p></li>
<li><p><cite>ALLOW_DEAD_ENDS_ONLY-U</cite> - turns are prohibited at all junctions, except those that have only one connected street feature (a dead end).</p></li>
<li><p><cite>ALLOW_DEAD_ENDS_AND_INTERSECTIONS_ONLY-U</cite> - turns are prohibited at pseudo-junctions where exactly two adjacent streets meet, but U-turns are permitted
at intersections and dead ends. This prevents turning around in the middle of the road where one length of road happened to be digitized as two street features.
The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value.</p></li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>time_window_factor</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Rates the importance of honoring time windows.
Allowed values: <cite>High</cite>, <cite>Medium</cite> or <cite>Low</cite>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>spatially_cluster_routes</p></td>
<td><p>Optional Boolean. If true, the dynamic seed points are automatically
created for all routes and the orders assigned to an individual
route are spatially clustered. This will reduce route intersections.
When using <cite>route_zones</cite> set this parameter to <cite>False</cite>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>route_zones</p></td>
<td><p>Optional FeatureSet. Delineates work territories for given routes. A
route zone is a polygon feature and is used to constrain routes to
servicing only those orders that fall within or near the specified
area.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>route_renewals</p></td>
<td><p>Optional FeatureSet. Specifies the intermediate depots that routes can visit to
reload or unload the cargo they are delivering or picking up.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>order_pairs</p></td>
<td><p>Optional FeatureSet. This parameter pairs pickup and delivery orders
so they are serviced by the same route.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>excess_transit_factor</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String.  Rates the importance of reducing excess transit time of
order pairs. Excess transit time is the amount of time exceeding the
time required to travel directly between the paired orders. Excess
time can be caused by driver breaks or travel to intermediate orders
and depots. Allowed values: <cite>High</cite>, <cite>Medium</cite> or <cite>Low</cite>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>point_barriers</p></td>
<td><p>Optional FeatureSet. Specify points that either completely restrict travel or
proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on the streets intersected
by the polygons.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>line_barriers</p></td>
<td><p>Optional FeatureSet. Specify polylines that either completely restrict travel or
proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on the streets intersected
by the polygons.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>polygon_barriers</p></td>
<td><p>Optional FeatureSet. Specify polygons that either completely restrict travel or
proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on the streets intersected
by the polygons.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>use_hierarchy_in_analysis</p></td>
<td><p>Optional Boolean. Specify whether hierarchy should be used when finding the best
routes. True means use hierarchy when finding routes.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>restrictions</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding
the best routes. A restriction represents a driving preference or requirement.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>attribute_parameter_values</p></td>
<td><p>Optional Dict.  Specify additional values required by some restrictions, such as the weight
of a vehicle for Weight Restriction. You can also use the attribute parameter to specify
whether any restriction prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on roads that use the
restriction.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>populate_route_lines</p></td>
<td><p>Optional Boolean. Specify if the output route line should be generated.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>route_line_simplification_tolerance</p></td>
<td><p>Optional Float. Specify by how much you want to simplify the geometry of the output lines
for routes and directions.The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel
Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value.The tool also ignores this parameter if the
populate_route_lines parameter is false. Simplification maintains critical points on a route,
such as turns at intersections, to define the essential shape of the route and removes other
points.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>populate_directions</p></td>
<td><p>Optional Boolean.  If True, the directions will be returned.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>directions_language</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Determines the output language of the directions.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>directions_style_name</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Determines the style of the directions.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>travel_mode</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Specify the mode of transportation to model in the analysis.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>impedance</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Specify the impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost
of traveling along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>time_zone_usage_for_time_fields</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Specifies the time zone for the input date-time fields supported by the tool. The default is GEO_LOCAL.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>save_output_layer</p></td>
<td><p>Optional Boolean. Specify if the tool should save the analysis settings as a network analysis
layer file. True means save the data and False means do not.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>overrides</p></td>
<td><p>Optional Dict. Specify additional settings that can influence the behavior of the solver when
finding solutions for the network analysis problems.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>save_route_data</p></td>
<td><p>Optional Boolean. Choose whether the output includes a zip file that contains a file geodatabase
holding the inputs and outputs of the analysis in a format that can be used to share route layers
with ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. True - Save the route data as a zip file. The
file is downloaded in a temporary directory on your machine. False - Do not save the route data.
This is the default.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>time_impedance</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Specify the time-based impedance, which is a value that represents the travel time
along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network. If the impedance for the travel
mode, as specified using the impedance parameter, is time-based, the value for time_impedance and
impedance parameters should be identical. Otherwise the service will return an error.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>distance_impedance</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. If the impedance for the travel mode, as specified using the impedance parameter, is
distance-based, the value for distance_impedance and impedance parameters should be identical. Otherwise
the service will return an error. Specify the distance-based impedance, which is a value that represents
the travel distance along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>populate_stop_shape</p></td>
<td><p>Optional Boolean. Specify if the tool should create the shapes for the output assigned and unassigned stops.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>output_format</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Specify the format in which the output features are created. Choose from the following formats:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Feature Set: The output features are returned as feature classes and tables. This is the default.</p></li>
<li><p>JSON File: The output features are returned as a compressed file containing the JSON representation of the outputs.
When this option is specified, the output is a single file (with a .zip extension) that contains one or more JSON
files (with a .json extension) for each of the outputs created by the service.</p></li>

<dd><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">solve_vehicle_routing_problem</span></code> tool solves a vehicle routing problem (VRP) to find the best routes for a fleet of vehicles.
A dispatcher managing a fleet of vehicles is often required to make decisions about vehicle routing. One such decision
involves how to best assign a group of customers to a fleet of vehicles and to sequence and schedule their visits. The
objectives in solving such vehicle routing problems (VRP) are to provide a high level of customer service by honoring
any time windows while keeping the overall operating and investment costs for each route as low as possible. The
constraints are to complete the routes with available resources and within the time limits imposed by driver work
shifts, driving speeds, and customer commitments. This method can be used to determine solutions for such complex
fleet management tasks.</p>
<p>Consider an example of delivering goods to grocery stores from a central warehouse location.
A fleet of three trucks is available at the warehouse. The warehouse operates only within a certain time window (from
8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.) during which all trucks must return back to the warehouse. Each truck has a capacity of 15,000
pounds, which limits the amount of goods it can carry. Each store has a demand for a specific amount of goods (
in pounds) that needs to be delivered, and each store has time windows that confine when deliveries should be made.
Furthermore, the driver can work only eight hours per day, requires a break for lunch, and is paid for the time spent
on driving and servicing the stores. The goal is to come up with an itinerary for each driver (or route) such that the
deliveries can be made while honoring all the service requirements and minimizing the total time spent on a particular
route by the driver.</p>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>orders</p></td>
<td><p>Required FeatureSet. Specify one or more orders (up to 2,000). These are the locations
that the routes of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) analysis
should visit. An order can represent a delivery (for example, furniture delivery),
a pickup (such as an airport shuttle bus picking up a passenger), or some type of service
or inspection (a tree trimming job or building inspection, for instance).</p>
<p>When specifying the orders, you can set properties for each one, such as its name or service time, by using
attributes. The orders can be specified with the following attributes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ObjectID</span></code>: The system-managed ID field.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Name</span></code>:  The name of the order. The name must be unique. If the name is left null,
a name is automatically generated at solve time.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Description</span></code>: The descriptive information about the order. This can contain any
textual information for the order and has no restrictions for uniqueness. You may want
to store a client’s ID number in the Name field and the client’s actual name or address
in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Description</span></code> field.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ServiceTime</span></code>:  This property specifies how much time will be spent at the
network location when the route visits it; that is, it stores the
impedance value for the network location. A zero or null value
indicates the network location requires no service time.
The unit for this field value is specified by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">time_units</span></code> parameter.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart1</span></code>: The beginning time of the first time window for the
network location. This field can contain a null value; a null value
indicates no beginning time.</p>
<p>A time window only states when a vehicle can
arrive at an order; it doesn’t state when the service time must be
completed. To account for service time and leave before the time window is over,
subtract <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ServiceTime</span></code> from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd1</span></code> field.</p>
<p>The time window fields (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart1</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd1</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart2</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd2</span></code>)
can contain a time-only value or a date and time value. If a time field such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart1</span></code> has a
time-only value (for example, 8:00 AM), the date is assumed to be the date specified by the Default Date parameter.
Using date and time values (for example, 7/11/2010 8:00 AM) allows you to set time windows that span multiple days.</p>
<p>When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, each order’s time-window values refer to the time
zone in which the order is located.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd1</span></code>: The ending time of the first window for the network
location. This field can contain a null value; a null value
indicates no ending time.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart2</span></code>: The beginning time of the second time window for the
network location. This field can contain a null value; a null value
indicates that there is no second time window.</p>
<p>If the first time window is null, as specified by
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart1</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd1</span></code> fields, the second time
window must also be null.</p>
<p>If both time windows are non null, they can’t
overlap. Also, the second time window must occur after the
first.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd2</span></code>:  The ending time of the second time window for the
network location. This field can contain a null
value.</p>
<p>When <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart2</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd2</span></code> are both
null, there is no second time window.</p>
<p>When <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart2</span></code> is not null but <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd2</span></code>
is null, there is a second time window that has a starting time but
no ending time. This is valid.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxViolationTime1</span></code>: A time window is considered violated if the arrival
time occurs after the time window has ended. This field specifies
the maximum allowable violation time for the first time window of
the order. It can contain a zero value but can’t contain negative
values. A zero value indicates that a time window violation at the
first time window of the order is unacceptable; that is, the first
time window is hard. On the other hand, a null value indicates that
there is no limit on the allowable violation time. A nonzero value
specifies the maximum amount of lateness; for example, a route can
arrive at an order up to 30 minutes beyond the end of its first
time window.</p>
<p>The unit for this field value is specified by the Time
Field Units parameter</p>
<p>Time window violations can be tracked and weighted by the
solver. Because of this, you can direct the VRP solver to take one
of three approaches:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Minimize the overall violation time, regardless of the
increase in travel cost for the fleet.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a solution that balances overall violation time and
travel cost.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore the overall violation time; instead, minimize
the travel cost for the fleet.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>By assigning an importance level for the Time Window
Violation Importance parameter, you are essentially choosing one of
these three approaches. In any case, however, the solver will
return an error if the value set for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxViolationTime1</span></code> is
surpassed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxViolationTime2</span></code>: The maximum allowable violation time for the second
time window of the order. This field is analogous to the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxViolationTime1</span></code> field.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">InboundArriveTime</span></code>: Defines when the item to be delivered to the order will be ready at
the starting depot. The order can be assigned to a route only if the inbound arrive time
the route’s latest start time value; this way, the route cannot leave the depot before the
item is ready to be loaded onto it.</p>
<p>This field can help model scenarios involving inbound-wave transshipments. For example, a
job at an order requires special materials that are not currently
available at the depot. The materials are being shipped from another location and will arrive
at the depot at 11:00 a.m. To ensure a route that leaves before the shipment arrives isn’t
assigned to the order, the order’s inbound arrive time is set to 11:00 a.m. The special materials
arrive at 11:00 a.m., they are loaded onto the vehicle, and the vehicle departs from the depot
to visit its assigned orders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The route’s start time, which includes service times, must occur after the inbound arrive time.
If a route begins before an order’s inbound arrive time, the order cannot be assigned to the route.
The assignment is invalid even if the route has a start-depot service time that lasts until after the inbound arrive time.</p></li>
<li><p>This time field can contain a time-only value or a date and time value. If a time-only value is
set (for example, 11:00 AM), the date is assumed to be the date specified by the Default Date parameter.
The default date is ignored, however, when any time field in the Depots, Routes, Orders, or Breaks includes a
date with the time. In that case, specify all such fields with a date and time (for example, 7/11/2015 11:00 AM).</p></li>
<li><p>The VRP solver honors InboundArriveTime regardless of the DeliveryQuantities value.</p></li>
<li><p>If an outbound depart time is also specified, its time value must occur after the inbound arrive time.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OutboundDepartTime</span></code>: Defines when the item to be picked up at the order must arrive at the ending depot.
The order can be assigned to a route only if the route can visit the order and reach its end depot before
the specified outbound depart time.</p>
<p>This field can help model scenarios involving outbound-wave transshipments.
For instance, a shipping company sends out delivery trucks to pick up packages from orders and bring them into a
depot where they are forwarded on to other facilities, en route to their final destination.
At 3:00 p.m. every day, a semitrailer stops at the depot to pick up the high-priority packages and take them
directly to a central processing station. To avoid delaying the high-priority packages until the next day’s 3:00 p.m.
trip, the shipping company tries to have delivery trucks pick up the high-priority packages from orders and bring them
to the depot before the 3:00 p.m. deadline. This is done by setting  the outbound depart time to 3:00 p.m.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The route’s end time, including service times, must occur before the outbound depart time. If a route reaches
a depot but doesn’t complete its end-depot service time prior to the order’s outbound depart time, the order cannot
be assigned to the route.</p></li>
<li><p>This time field can contain a time-only value or a date and time value. If a time-only value is
set (for example, 11:00 AM), the date is assumed to be the date specified by the Default Date parameter.
The default date is ignored, however, when any time field in Depots, Routes, Orders, or Breaks includes
a date with the time. In that case, specify all such fields with a date and time (for example, 7/11/2015 11:00 AM).</p></li>
<li><p>The VRP solver honors <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OutboundDepartTime</span></code> regardless of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PickupQuantities</span></code> value.</p></li>
<li><p>If an inbound arrive time is also specified, its time value must occur before the  outbound depart time.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DeliveryQuantities</span></code>: The size of the delivery. You can specify size in any dimension you want, such as weight,
volume, or quantity. You can even specify multiple dimensions, for example, weight and volume.</p>
<p>Enter delivery quantities without indicating units.
For example, if a 300-pound object needs to be delivered to an
order, enter 300. You will need to remember that the value is in
pounds.</p>
<p>If you are tracking multiple dimensions, separate
the numeric values with a space. For instance, if you are recording
the weight and volume of a delivery that weighs 2,000 pounds and
has a volume of 100 cubic feet, enter 2000 100. Again, you need to
remember the units-in this case, pounds and cubic feet. You also
need to remember the sequence in which the values and their corresponding
units are entered.</p>
<p>Make sure that Capacities for Routes and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DeliveryQuantities</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PickupQuantities</span></code> for Orders are specified in
the same manner; that is, the values need to be in the same units,
and if you are using multiple dimensions, the dimensions need to be
listed in the same sequence for all parameters. So if you specify
weight in pounds, followed by volume in cubic feet for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DeliveryQuantities</span></code>, the capacity of your routes and the pickup
quantities of your orders need to be specified the same way: weight in
pounds, then volume in cubic feet. If you mix units or change the
sequence, you will get unwanted results without receiving any
warning messages.</p>
<p>An empty string or null value is equivalent to all
dimensions being zero. If the string has an insufficient number of
values in relation to the capacity count, or dimensions being
tracked, the remaining values are treated as zeros. Delivery
quantities can’t be negative.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PickupQuantities</span></code>: The size of the pickup. You can specify size in any
dimension you want, such as weight, volume, or quantity. You can
even specify multiple dimensions, for example, weight and volume.
You cannot, however, use negative values. This field is analogous
to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DeliveryQuantities</span></code> field of Orders.</p>
<p>In the case of an exchange visit, an order can have
both delivery and pickup quantities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Revenue</span></code>: The income generated if the order is included in a
solution. This field can contain a null value-a null value
indicates zero revenue-but it can’t have a negative
value.</p>
<p>Revenue is included in optimizing the objective
function value but is not part of the solution’s operating cost;
that is, the TotalCost field in the route class never includes
revenue in its output. However, revenue weights the relative
importance of servicing orders.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpecialtyNames</span></code>: A space-separated string containing the names of the
specialties required by the order. A null value indicates that the
order doesn’t require specialties.</p>
<p>The spelling of any specialties listed in the Orders
and Routes classes must match exactly so that the VRP solver can
link them together.</p>
<p>To illustrate what specialties are and how they
work, assume a lawn care and tree trimming company has a portion of
its orders that requires a bucket truck to trim tall trees. The
company would enter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BucketTruck</span></code> in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpecialtyNames</span></code> field for
these orders to indicate their special need. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpecialtyNames</span></code> would
be left as null for the other orders. Similarly, the company would
also enter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BucketTruck</span></code> in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpecialtyNames</span></code> field of routes that
are driven by trucks with hydraulic booms. It would leave the field
null for the other routes. At solve time, the VRP solver assigns
orders without special needs to any route, but it only assigns
orders that need bucket trucks to routes that have
them.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AssignmentRule</span></code>: This field specifies the rule for assigning the order to a
route. It is constrained by a domain of values, which are listed
below (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 (Exclude) - The order is to be excluded from the
subsequent solve operation.</p></li>
<li><p>1 (Preserve route and relative sequence) - The solver must
always assign the order to the preassigned route and at the
preassigned relative sequence during the solve operation. If this
assignment rule can’t be followed, it results in an order
violation. With this setting, only the relative sequence is
maintained, not the absolute sequence. To illustrate what this
means, imagine there are two orders: A and B. They have sequence
values of 2 and 3, respectively. If you set their AssignmentRule
field values to Preserve route and relative sequence, A and B’s
actual sequence values may change after solving because other
orders, breaks, and depot visits could still be sequenced before,
between, or after A and B. However, B cannot be sequenced before A.</p></li>
<li><p>2 (Preserve route) - The solver must always assign the
order to the preassigned route during the solve operation. A valid
sequence must also be set even though the sequence may or may not
be preserved. If the order can’t be assigned to the specified
route, it results in an order violation.</p></li>
<li><p>3 (Override) - The solver tries to preserve the route
and sequence preassignment for the order during the solve
operation. However, a new route or sequence for the order may
be assigned if it helps minimize the overall value of the objective
function. This is the default value.</p></li>
<li><p>4 (Anchor first) - The solver ignores the route and sequence preassignment (if any)
for the order during the solve operation. It assigns a route to the order and makes
it the first order on that route to minimize the overall value of the objective function.</p></li>
<li><p>5 (Anchor last) - The solver ignores the route and sequence preassignment (if any) for the
order during the solve operation. It assigns a route to the order and makes it the last
order on that route to minimize the overall value of the objective function.
This field can’t contain a null value.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code>:  Specifies the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart from the order.
The field value is specified as one of the following integers shown in the parentheses (use the
numeric code, not the name in parentheses):</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Either side of vehicle</p></td>
<td><p><img alt="either" src="_images/either_side.png" />
The vehicle can approach and depart the order in either
direction, so a U-turn is allowed at the order. This setting
can be chosen if it is possible and desirable for your vehicle
to turn around at the order. This decision may depend on the
width of the road and the amount of traffic or whether the
order has a parking lot where vehicles can pull in and turn
around.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>right side of vehicle</p></td>
<td><p><img alt="right" src="_images/right_side.png" />
When the vehicle approaches and departs the order, the order must
be on the right side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited. This is
typically used for vehicles like buses that must arrive with the bus
stop on the right side.</p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>left side of vehicle</p></td>
<td><p><img alt="left" src="_images/left_side.png" />

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code> property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards:
right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider an
order on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the
vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving
standards is your decision to approach an order from one of two directions, that is, so it ends
up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at an order and
not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the order, you would choose 1 (Right side of
vehicle) in the United States but 2 (Left side of vehicle) in the United Kingdom.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code>: The name of the route to which the order is assigned. As an input field, this field is used to preassign
an order to a specific route. (A maximum of 200 orders can be preassigned to one route name.) It can contain a null value,
indicating that the order is not preassigned to any route, and the solver determines the best possible route assignment for the order.
If this is set to null, the sequence field must also be set to null.</p>
<p>After a solve operation, if the order is routed, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code> field contains the name of the route to which the order is
assigned.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sequence</span></code>: This indicates the sequence of the order on its assigned route.</p>
<p>As an input field, this field is used to specify the
relative sequence for an order on the route. This field can contain
a null value specifying that the order can be placed anywhere along
the route. A null value can only occur together with a null
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code> value.</p>
<p>The input sequence values are positive and unique
for each route (shared across renewal depot visits, orders, and
breaks) but do not need to start from 1 or be
contiguous.</p>
<p>After a solve operation, the Sequence field contains
the sequence value of the order on its assigned route. Output
sequence values for a route are shared across depot visits, orders,
and breaks; start from 1 (at the starting depot); and are
consecutive. So the smallest possible output sequence value for a
routed order is 2, since a route always begins at a depot.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bearing</span></code>: The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and are measured
clockwise from true north. This field is used in conjunction with the BearingTol field.
Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile device equipped with a GPS receiver.
Try to include bearing data if you are loading an input location that is moving, such as a pedestrian or a vehicle.
Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle is near an
intersection or an overpass for example. Bearing also helps the tool determine on which side of the street the point is.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BearingTol</span></code>: The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable bearing values when
locating moving points on an edge using the Bearing field. If the value from the Bearing field is
within the range of acceptable values that are generated from the bearing tolerance on an edge, the
point can be added as a network location there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is evaluated.</p>
<p>The units are in degrees, and the default value is 30. Values must be greater than 0 and less than 180.
A value of 30 means that when ArcGIS Network Analyst extension attempts to add a network location on an
edge, a range of acceptable bearing values is generated 15 degrees to either side of the edge (left and right)
and in both digitized directions of the edge.</p>
</li>

<td><p>Required FeatureSet. Specify one or more depots for the given vehicle routing problem. A depot is a location that
a vehicle departs from at the beginning of its workday and returns to at the end of the workday. Vehicles are
loaded (for deliveries) or unloaded (for pickups) at depots at the start of the route. In some cases, a depot can also act as a
renewal location whereby the vehicle can unload or reload and continue performing deliveries and pickups. A depot has open and
close times, as specified by a hard time window. Vehicles can’t arrive at a depot outside of this time window.
When specifying the orders, you can set properties for each one, such as its name or service time, by using attributes.</p>
<p>The orders can be specified with the following attributes:</p>

<p>Depot names are case insensitive and have to be nonempty and unique.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Description</span></code> : The descriptive information about the depot location. This can contain any textual information and has
no restrictions for uniqueness.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to note which region a depot is in or the depot’s address and telephone number, you can enter
the information here rather than in the Name field.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart1</span></code>: The beginning time of the first time window for the network location. This field can contain a null value;
a null value indicates no beginning time.</p>
<p>Time window fields can contain a time-only value or a date and time value. If a time field has a time-only value (for example,
8:00 AM), the date is assumed to be the date specified by the Default Date parameter of the analysis layer. Using date and time
values (for example, 7/11/2010 8:00 AM) allows you to set time windows that span multiple days.</p>
<p>When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, each depot’s time-window values refer to the time zone in which the depot is located.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd1</span></code>: The ending time of the first window for the network

indicates no ending time.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart2</span></code>: The beginning time of the second time window for the network location.
This field can contain a null value; a null value indicates that there is no second time window.</p>
<p>If the first time window is null, as specified by the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart1</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd1</span></code> fields, the second time window
must also be null.</p>
<p>If both time windows are nonnull, they can’t overlap.
Also, the second time window must occur after the first.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd2</span></code>: The ending time of the second time window for the network

<p>When <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart2</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd2</span></code> are both null,
there is no second time window.</p>
<p>When <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart2</span></code> is not null but <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd2</span></code> is

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code> property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States)
and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a depot on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side
regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards
is your decision to approach a depot from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle.
For example, if you want to arrive at a depot and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the depot, you would choose
1 (Right side of vehicle) in the United States but 2 (Left side of vehicle) in the United Kingdom.</p>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bearing</span></code>: The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and measured in a clockwise fashion from true north.
This field is used in conjunction with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BearingTol</span></code> field.</p>
<p>Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile
device equipped with a GPS receiver. Try to include bearing
data if you are loading an order that is moving, such as a
pedestrian or a vehicle.</p>
<p>Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the
wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle is near an intersection
or an overpass, for example. Bearing also helps the tool
determine on which side of the street the point is.
For more information, see the Bearing and Bearing Tolerance Help topic (<a class="reference external" href="http://links.esri.com/bearing-and-bearing-tolerance">http://links.esri.com/bearing-and-bearing-tolerance</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BearingTol</span></code>: The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable
bearing values when locating moving points on an edge using the
Bearing field. If the value from the Bearing field is within the
range of acceptable values that are generated from the bearing
tolerance on an edge, the point can be added as a network location
there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is
evaluated.</p>
<p>The units are in degrees and the default value is 30.
Values must be greater than zero and less than 180.</p>
<p>A value of 30 means that when Network Analyst attempts to
add a network location on an edge, a range of acceptable bearing
values is generated 15 degrees to either side of the edge (left and
right) and in both digitized directions of the edge.

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>routes</p></td>
<td><p>Required FeatureSet.  Specify one or more routes (up to 100). A route specifies vehicle and driver
characteristics; after solving, it also represents the path between
depots and orders.</p>
<p>A route can have start and end depot service times, a  fixed or flexible starting time, time-based operating costs,
distance-based operating costs, multiple capacities, various constraints on a driver’s workday, and so on.
When specifying the routes, you can set properties for each one by using attributes.
The routes can be specified with the following attributes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Name</span></code>: The name of the route. The name must be unique.</p>
<p>The tool  generates a unique name at solve time if the field value is null; therefore, entering a value is optional in
most cases. However, you must enter a name if your analysis includes breaks, route renewals, route zones, or orders that are
preassigned to a route because the route name is used as a foreign
key in these cases. Note that route names are case insensitive.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StartDepotName</span></code>: The name of the starting depot for the route. This field
is a foreign key to the Name field in Depots.</p>
<p>If the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StartDepotName</span></code> value is null, the route will begin
from the first order assigned. Omitting the start depot is useful
when the vehicle’s starting location is unknown or irrelevant to
your problem. However, when <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StartDepotName</span></code> is null, EndDepotName
cannot also be null.</p>
<p>If the route is making deliveries and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StartDepotName</span></code> is
null, it is assumed the cargo is loaded on the vehicle at a virtual
depot before the route begins. For a route that has no renewal
visits, its delivery orders (those with nonzero DeliveryQuantities
values in the Orders class) are loaded at the start depot or
virtual depot. For a route that has renewal visits, only the
delivery orders before the first renewal visit are loaded at the
start depot or virtual depot.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EndDepotName</span></code>: The name of the ending depot for the route. This field is a foreign key to the Name field in the Depots class.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StartDepotServiceTime</span></code>: The service time at the starting depot. This can be used to model the time spent for loading the vehicle.
This field can contain a null value; a null value indicates zero service time.</p>
<p>The unit for this field value is specified by the Time
Field Units parameter.</p>
<p>The service times at the start and end depots are fixed
values (given by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StartDepotServiceTime</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EndDepotServiceTime</span></code>
field values) and do not take into account the actual load for a
route. For example, the time taken to load a vehicle at the
starting depot may depend on the size of the orders. As such, the
depot service times could be given values corresponding to a full
truckload or an average truckload, or you could make your own time
estimate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EndDepotServiceTime</span></code>: The service time at the ending depot. This can be used to model the time spent for unloading the vehicle.
This field can contain a null value; a null value indicates zero service time.</p>
<p>The unit for this field value is specified by the Time
Field Units parameter.</p>
<p>The service times at the start and end depots are fixed
values (given by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StartDepotServiceTime</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EndDepotServiceTime</span></code>
field values) and do not take into account the actual load for a
route. For example, the time taken to load a vehicle at the
starting depot may depend on the size of the orders. As such, the
depot service times could be given values corresponding to a full
truckload or an average truckload, or you could make your own time
estimate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EarliestStartTime</span></code>: The earliest allowable starting time for the route. This
is used by the solver in conjunction with the time window of the
starting depot for determining feasible route start
times.</p>
<p>This field can’t contain null values and has a default
time-only value of 8:00 AM; the default value is interpreted as
8:00 a.m. on the date given by the Default Date
parameter.</p>
<p>When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, the
time zone for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EarliestStartTime</span></code> is the same as the time zone in which the starting depot is located.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LatestStartTime</span></code>: The latest allowable starting time for the route. This
field can’t contain null values and has a default time-only value
of 10:00 AM; the default value is interpreted as 10:00 a.m. on the
date given by the Default Date property of the analysis
layer.</p>
<p>When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, the
time zone for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LatestStartTime</span></code> is the same as the time zone in which the starting depot is located.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ArriveDepartDelay</span></code>: This field stores the amount of travel time needed to
accelerate the vehicle to normal travel speeds, decelerate it to a
stop, and move it off and on the network (for example, in and out
of parking). By including an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ArriveDepartDelay</span></code> value, the VRP
solver is deterred from sending many routes to service physically
coincident orders.</p>
<p>The cost for this property is incurred between visits to
noncoincident orders, depots, and route renewals. For example, when
a route starts from a depot and visits the first order, the total
arrive/depart delay is added to the travel time. The same is true
when traveling from the first order to the second order. If the
second and third orders are coincident, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ArriveDepartDelay</span></code> value
is not added between them since the vehicle doesn’t need to move.
If the route travels to a route renewal, the value is added to the
travel time again.</p>
<p>Although a vehicle needs to slow down and stop for a break
and accelerate afterwards, the VRP solver cannot add the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ArriveDepartDelay</span></code> value for breaks. This means that if a route
leaves an order, stops for a break, and continues to the next
order, the arrive/depart delay is added only once, not
twice.</p>
<p>To illustrate, assume there are five coincident orders in
a high-rise building, and they are serviced by three different
routes. This means three arrive/depart delays would be incurred;
that is, three drivers would need to separately find parking places
and enter the same building. However, if the orders could be
serviced by just one route instead, only one driver would need to
park and enter the building-only one arrive/depart delay would be
incurred. Since the VRP solver tries to minimize cost, it will try
to limit the arrive/depart delays and thus choose the single-route
option. (Note that multiple routes may need to be sent when other
constraints-such as specialties, time windows, or
capacities-require it.)
The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Capacities</span></code>: The maximum capacity of the vehicle. You can specify
capacity in any dimension you want, such as weight, volume, or
quantity. You can even specify multiple dimensions, for example,
weight and volume.</p>
<p>Enter capacities without indicating units. For example,
assume your vehicle can carry a maximum of 40,000 pounds; you would
enter 40000. You need to remember for future reference that the
value is in pounds.</p>
<p>If you are tracking multiple dimensions, separate the
numeric values with a space. For instance, if you are recording
both weight and volume and your vehicle can carry a maximum weight
of 40,000 pounds and a maximum volume of 2,000 cubic feet,
Capacities should be entered as 40000 2000. Again, you need to
remember the units. You also need to remember the sequence in which the
values and their corresponding units are entered (pounds
followed by cubic feet in this case).</p>
<p>Remembering the units and the unit sequence is important
for a couple of reasons: one, so you can reinterpret the
information later; two, so you can properly enter values for the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DeliveryQuantities</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PickupQuantities</span></code> fields for the orders. To
elaborate on the second point, note that the VRP solver
simultaneously refers to Capacities, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DeliveryQuantities</span></code>, and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PickupQuantities</span></code> to make sure that a route doesn’t become
overloaded. Since units can’t be entered in the field, the VRP tool can’t make unit conversions, so you need to enter the
values for the three fields using the same units and the same unit
sequence to ensure the values are correctly interpreted. If you mix
units or change the sequence in any of the three fields, you will
get unwanted results without receiving any warning messages. Thus,
it is a good idea to set up a unit and unit-sequence standard
beforehand and continually refer to it whenever entering values for
these three fields.</p>
<p>An empty string or null value is equivalent to all values
being zero. Capacity values can’t be negative.</p>
<p>If the Capacities string has an insufficient number of
values in relation to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DeliveryQuantities</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PickupQuantities</span></code>
fields for orders, the remaining values are treated as
zero.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FixedCost</span></code>: A fixed monetary cost that is incurred only if the route
is used in a solution (that is, it has orders assigned to it). This
field can contain null values; a null value indicates zero fixed
cost. This cost is part of the total route operating
cost.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CostPerUnitTime</span></code>: The monetary cost incurred-per unit of work time-for the
total route duration, including travel times as well as service
times and wait times at orders, depots, and breaks. This field
can’t contain a null value and has a default value of
1.0.
The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CostPerUnitDistance</span></code>: The monetary cost incurred-per unit of distance
traveled-for the route length (total travel distance). This field
can contain null values; a null value indicates zero
cost.
The unit for this field value is specified by the distance_units parameter.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OvertimeStartTime</span></code>: The duration of regular work time before overtime
computation begins. This field can contain null values; a null
value indicates that overtime does not apply.
The unit for this field value is specified by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">time_units</span></code> parameter.
For example, if the driver is to be paid overtime pay when
the total route duration extends beyond eight hours,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OvertimeStartTime</span></code> is specified as 480 (8 hours * 60 minutes/hour),
given the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">time_units</span></code> parameter is set to Minutes.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CostPerUnitOvertime</span></code>: The monetary cost incurred per time unit of overtime work.
This field can contain null values; a null value indicates that the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CostPerUnitOvertime</span></code> value is the same as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CostPerUnitTime</span></code>
value.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxOrderCount</span></code>: The maximum allowable number of orders on the route. This
field can’t contain null values and has a default value of
30. This value cannot exceed 200.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxTotalTime</span></code>: The maximum allowable route duration. The route duration
includes travel times as well as service and wait times at orders,
depots, and breaks. This field can contain null values; a null
value indicates that there is no constraint on the route
duration.
The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxTotalTravelTime</span></code>: The maximum allowable travel time for the route. The
travel time includes only the time spent driving on the network and
does not include service or wait times.</p>
<p>This field can contain null values; a null value indicates
there is no constraint on the maximum allowable travel time. This
field value can’t be larger than the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxTotalTime</span></code> field
value.
The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxTotalDistance</span></code>: The maximum allowable travel distance for the
route.
The unit for this field value is specified by the distance_units parameter.
This field can contain null values; a null value indicates
that there is no constraint on the maximum allowable travel
distance.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpecialtyNames</span></code>: A space-separated string containing the names of the
specialties supported by the route. A null value indicates that the
route does not support any specialties.</p>
<p>This field is a foreign key to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpecialtyNames</span></code> field in
the orders class.</p>
<p>To illustrate what specialties are and how they work,
assume a lawn care and tree trimming company has a portion of its
orders that requires a bucket truck to trim tall trees. The company
would enter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BucketTruck</span></code> in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpecialtyNames</span></code> field for these
orders to indicate their special need. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpecialtyNames</span></code> would be left
as null for the other orders. Similarly, the company would also
enter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BucketTruck</span></code> in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpecialtyNames</span></code> field of routes that are
driven by trucks with hydraulic booms. It would leave the field
null for the other routes. At solve time, the VRP solver assigns
orders without special needs to any route, but it only assigns
orders that need bucket trucks to routes that have them.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AssignmentRule</span></code>: This specifies whether the route can be used or not when

and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxCumulWorkTime</span></code>.</p>
<p>An error will occur at solve time if a route has multiple
breaks with overlapping time windows.</p>
<p>The time window fields in breaks can contain a time-only
value or a date and time value. If a time field, such as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart</span></code>, has a time-only value (for example, 12:00 PM), the
date is assumed to be the date specified by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">default_date</span></code>
parameter. Using date and time values (for example, 7/11/2012 12:00
PM) allows you to specify time windows that span two or more days.
This is especially beneficial when a break should be taken sometime
before and after midnight.
When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, each break’s time-window
values refer to the time zone in which the associated route, as specified by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code> field,
is located.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code>: The ending time of the break’s time window.</p>
<p>If this field is null and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart</span></code> has a valid
time-of-day value, the break is allowed to start any time after the

<p>If this field has a value, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxCumulWorkTime</span></code> must be null; moreover, all other breaks in the
analysis layer must have null values for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxCumulWorkTime</span></code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxViolationTime</span></code>: This field specifies the maximum allowable violation time
for a time-window break. A time window is considered violated if
the arrival time falls outside the time range.</p>
<p>A zero value indicates the time window cannot be violated;
that is, the time window is hard. A nonzero value specifies the
maximum amount of lateness; for example, the break can begin up to
30 minutes beyond the end of its time window, but the lateness is
penalized as per the Time Window Violation Importance
parameter.</p>
<p>This property can be null; a null value with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code> values indicates that there is no
limit on the allowable violation time. If
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxCumulWorkTime</span></code> has a value,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxViolationTime</span></code> must be null.
The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks</span></code>: The maximum amount of travel time that can be accumulated
before the break is taken. The travel time is accumulated either
from the end of the previous break or, if a break has not yet been
taken, from the start of the route.</p>
<p>If this is the route’s final break,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks</span></code> also indicates the maximum travel time
that can be accumulated from the final break to the end
depot.</p>
<p>This field is designed to limit how long a person can
drive until a break is required. For instance, if the Time Field
Units parameter (time_units for Python) of the analysis is set to
Minutes, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks</span></code> has a value of 120, the
driver will get a break after two hours of driving. To assign a
second break after two more hours of driving, the second break’s
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks</span></code> property should be 120.</p>
<p>If this field has a value, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxViolationTime</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxCumulWorkTime</span></code> must be null for an analysis
to solve successfully.
The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxCumulWorkTime</span></code>: The maximum amount of work time that can be accumulated
before the break is taken. Work time is always accumulated from the
beginning of the route.</p>
<p>Work time is the sum of travel time and service times at
orders, depots, and breaks. Note, however, that this excludes wait
time, which is the time a route (or driver) spends waiting at an
order or depot for a time window to begin.</p>
<p>This field is designed to limit how long a person can work
until a break is required. For instance, if the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">time_units</span></code>
parameter is set to Minutes,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxCumulWorkTime</span></code> has a value of 120, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ServiceTime</span></code> has a value of
15, the driver will get a 15-minute break after two hours of
work.</p>
<p>Continuing with the last example, assume a second break is
needed after three more hours of work. To specify this break, you
would enter 315 (five hours and 15 minutes) as the second break’s
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxCumulWorkTime</span></code> value. This number includes the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxCumulWorkTime</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ServiceTime</span></code> values of the preceding break, along with the three
additional hours of work time before granting the second break. To
avoid taking maximum-work-time breaks prematurely, remember that
they accumulate work time from the beginning of the route and that
work time includes the service time at previously visited depots,
orders, and breaks.</p>
<p>If this field has a value, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxViolationTime</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks</span></code> must be null for
an analysis to solve successfully.
The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">IsPaid</span></code>: A Boolean value indicating whether the break is paid or
unpaid. A True value indicates that the time spent at the break is
included in the route cost computation and overtime determination.
A False value indicates otherwise. The default value is
True.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sequence</span></code>: As an input field, this indicates the sequence of the
break on its route. This field can contain null values. The input
sequence values are positive and unique for each route (shared
across renewal depot visits, orders, and breaks) but need not start
from 1 or be contiguous.</p>
<p>The solver modifies the sequence field. After solving,
this field contains the sequence value of the break on its route.
Output sequence values for a route are shared across depot visits,
orders, and breaks; start from 1 (at the starting depot); and are
consecutive.</p>

<td><p>Optional FeatureSet. Delineates work territories for given routes. A route zone
is a polygon feature and is used to constrain routes to servicing
only those orders that fall within or near the specified area. Here
are some examples of when route zones may be useful:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Some of your employees don’t have the required permits to

<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code>: The name of the route to which this zone applies. A route

that such orders can still be assigned, but the cost of servicing
the order is weighted by a function that is based on the Euclidean
distance from the route zone. Basically, this means that as the

the likelihood of the order being assigned to the route

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>route_renewals</p></td>
<td><p>Optional FeatureSet. Specifies the intermediate depots that routes can visit to
reload or unload the cargo they are delivering or picking up.
Specifically, a route renewal links a route to a depot. The
relationship indicates the route can renew (reload or unload while
en route) at the associated depot.</p>
<p>Route renewals can be used to model scenarios in which a
vehicle picks up a full load of deliveries at the starting depot,
services the orders, returns to the depot to renew its load of
deliveries, and continues servicing more orders. For example, in
propane gas delivery, the vehicle may make several deliveries until
its tank is nearly or completely depleted, visit a refueling point,
and make more deliveries.</p>
<p>Here are a few rules and options to consider when also
working with route seed points:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The reload/unload point, or renewal location, can be
different from the start or end depot.</p></li>
<li><p>Each route can have one or many predetermined renewal
locations.</p></li>
<li><p>A renewal location may be used more than once by a single
route.</p></li>
<li><p>In some cases where there may be several potential renewal
locations for a route, the closest available renewal location is
chosen by the solver.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When specifying the route renewals, you need to set properties for each one, such
as the name of the depot where the route renewal can occur, by using attributes.

* <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ObjectID</span></code>: The system-managed ID field.
* <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DepotName</span></code>: The name of the depot where this renewal takes place. This</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>field can’t contain a null value and is a foreign key to the Name
field in the depots parameter.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code>: The name of the route to which this renewal applies. This

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ServiceTime</span></code>: The service time for the renewal. This field can contain a
null value; a null value indicates zero service time.
The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter.
The time taken to load a vehicle at a renewal depot may
depend on the size of the vehicle and how full or empty the vehicle
is. However, the service time for a route renewal is a fixed value
and does not take into account the actual load. As such, the
renewal service time should be given a value corresponding to a
full truckload, an average truckload, or another time estimate of
your choice.</p></li>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>order_pairs</p></td>
<td><p>Optional FeatureSet. This parameter pairs pickup and delivery orders so they are serviced by the same route.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is required that the pickup and delivery for
orders be paired. For example, a courier company might need to have
a route pick up a high-priority package from one order and deliver
it to another without returning to a depot, or sorting station, to
minimize delivery time. These related orders can be assigned to the
same route with the appropriate sequence by using order pairs.
Moreover, restrictions on how long the package can stay in the
vehicle can also be assigned; for example, the package might be a
blood sample that has to be transported from the doctor’s office to
the lab within two hours.
When specifying the order pairs, you need to set properties for each one, such as the names of the two orders,
by using attributes. The order pairs can be specified with the following attributes:
* <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ObjectID</span></code>: The system-managed ID field.
* <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FirstOrderName</span></code>: The name of the first order of the pair. This field is a</p>

is, the value for its <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DeliveryQuantities</span></code> field is null. The second
order in the pair must be a delivery order; that is, the value for
its <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PickupQuantities</span></code> field is null. The quantity picked up
at the first order must agree with the quantity delivered
at the second order. As a special case, both orders may have zero
quantities for scenarios where capacities are not used.</p>
<p>The order quantities are not loaded or unloaded at
depots.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MaxTransitTime</span></code>: The maximum transit time for the pair. The transit time is
the duration from the departure time of the first order to the
arrival time at the second order. This constraint limits the
time-on-vehicle, or ride time, between the two orders. When a
vehicle is carrying people or perishable goods, the ride time is
typically shorter than that of a vehicle carrying packages or
nonperishable goods. This field can contain null values; a null
value indicates that there is no constraint on the ride
time.
The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter.
Excess transit time (measured with respect to the direct
travel time between order pairs) can be tracked and weighted by the
solver. Because of this, you can direct the VRP solver to take one
of three approaches:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Minimize the overall excess transit time, regardless of
the increase in travel cost for the fleet.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a solution that balances overall violation time and

services.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Medium</span></code> - This is the default setting. The solver looks for
a balance between reducing excess transit time and reducing the
overall solution cost.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Low</span></code> - The solver tries to find a solution that minimizes
overall solution cost, regardless of excess transit time. This
setting is commonly used with courier services. Since couriers
transport packages as opposed to people, they don’t need to worry
about ride time. Using Low allows the couriers to service paired

<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 (Either side of vehicle): The barrier affects travel over the edge in both directions.</p></li>

</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Since junctions are points and don’t have a side, barriers on junctions affect all vehicles
regardless of the curb approach.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code> property was designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards:
right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a
facility on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether
the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving
standards is your decision to approach a facility from one of two directions, that is, so it
ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at a facility
and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the facility, you would choose Right side of
vehicle (1) in the United States but Left side of vehicle (2) in the United Kingdom.</p>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bearing</span></code>: The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and are measured clockwise
from true north. This field is used in conjunction with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BearingTol</span></code> field.</p>
<p>Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile device equipped with a GPS receiver.
Try to include bearing data if you are loading an input location that is moving, such as a pedestrian or a vehicle.</p>
<p>Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle
is near an intersection or an overpass for example. Bearing also helps the tool determine on which side
of the street the point is.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BearingTol</span></code>: The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable bearing values when locating moving
points on an edge using the Bearing field. If the value from the Bearing field is within the range of acceptable
values that are generated from the bearing tolerance on an edge, the point can be added as a network location
there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is evaluated.</p>
<p>The units are in degrees, and the default value is 30. Values must be greater than 0 and less than 180.
A value of 30 means that when ArcGIS Network Analyst extension attempts to add a network location on an edge,
a range of acceptable bearing values is generated 15 degrees to either side of the edge (left and right) and
in both digitized directions of the edge.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NavLatency</span></code>: This field is only used in the solve process if Bearing and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BearingTol</span></code> also have values;
however, entering a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NavLatency</span></code> value is optional, even when values are present in Bearing and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BearingTol</span></code>.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NavLatency</span></code> indicates how much time is expected to elapse from the moment GPS information is sent from a
moving vehicle to a server and the moment the processed route is received by the vehicle’s navigation device.</p>
<p>The time units of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NavLatency</span></code> are the same as the units specified by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">timeUnits</span></code> property of the analysis object.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>line_barriers</p></td>
<td><p>Optional FeatureSet.  Specify one or more lines that prohibit travel anywhere
the lines intersect the streets. For example, a parade or protest
that blocks traffic across several street segments can be modeled
with a line barrier. A line barrier can also quickly fence off
several roads from being traversed, thereby channeling possible
routes away from undesirable parts of the street
network.</p>
<p>The tool imposes a limit on the number of streets you can
restrict using the Line Barriers parameter. While there is no limit on
the number of lines you can specify as line barriers, the combined

<p>The service imposes a limit on the number of streets you

no limit on the number of polygons you can specify as the polygon
barriers, the combined number of streets intersected by all the

value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 (Restriction) - Prohibits traveling through any part of the barrier.
The barrier is referred to as a restriction polygon barrier since it
prohibits traveling on streets intersected by the barrier. One use
of this type of barrier is to model floods covering areas of the
street that make traveling on those streets impossible.</p></li>
<li><p>1 (Scaled Cost) - Scales the time or distance required to travel the

or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ScaledDistanceFactor</span></code> fields. If the streets are partially
covered by the barrier, the travel time or distance is apportioned
and then scaled. For example, a factor 0.25 would mean that travel
on underlying streets is expected to be four times faster than
normal. A factor of 3.0 would mean it is expected to take three
times longer than normal to travel on underlying streets. This
barrier type is referred to as a scaled-cost polygon barrier. It
might be used to model storms that reduce travel speeds in specific

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>use_hierarchy_in_analysis</p></td>
<td><p>Optional boolean. Specify whether hierarchy should be used when finding the best routes.</p>
<p>Checked (True) - Use hierarchy when finding routes. When
hierarchy is used, the tool prefers higher-order streets, such as
freeways, to lower-order streets, such as local roads, and can be used
to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead
of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially
true when finding routes to faraway locations, because drivers on long-distance trips tend to prefer traveling on freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided. Using hierarchy is computationally faster,
especially for long-distance routes, as the tool has to select the
best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.</p>
<p>Unchecked (False) - Do not use hierarchy when finding routes. If
hierarchy is not used, the tool considers all the streets and doesn’t
prefer higher-order streets when finding the route. This is often
used when finding short-distance routes within a city.</p>
<p>The tool automatically reverts to using hierarchy if the
straight-line distance between orders, depots, or orders and depots is

<td><p>Optional string. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes.  The value you provide for this parameter
is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value. A restriction represents a driving
preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads
to be prohibited. For instance, using an Avoid Toll Roads restriction will result in a route that will include
roads only when it is absolutely required to travel on toll roads in order to visit an incident or a facility.
Height Restriction makes it possible to route around any clearances that are lower than the height of your vehicle.
If you are carrying corrosive materials on your vehicle, using the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling
the materials along roads where it is marked as illegal to do so.</p>
<p>Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.
Some restrictions require an additional value to be
specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work
with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
names appear under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AttributeName</span></code> column in the Attribute
Parameter Values parameter. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code> field should be
specified in the Attribute Parameter Values parameter for the
restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.</p>
<p>Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in the list below.
Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether the restriction is available
in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section of the Data coverage for network analysis
services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select
availability in the region is supported in that country. If you specify restriction names that are not available in
the country where your incidents are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also ignores
restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value parameter).
It prohibits all restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.</p>

The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value.
If you specify the Attribute Parameter Values parameter from a feature class, the field names on the feature class must match the fields as described below:</p>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code>: The value for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code> used by the tool when evaluating the restriction.</p>
<p>Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the Restrictions parameter. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code> field is applicable only
if the restriction name is specified as the value for the
Restrictions parameter.</p>
<p>In Attribute Parameter Values, each restriction (listed as <cite>AttributeName</cite>) has a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code> field
value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction
prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with
the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
preferred. The Restriction Usage <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code> can be assigned any of

</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

<p>To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GetTravelModes</span></code> tool from the Utilities toolbox available under the same GIS Server connection
you used to access the tool. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GetTravelModes</span></code> tool adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the
tool does not have to lookup the settings based on the travel mode name.</p>
<p>The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values,  and Impedance).
The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model travelling by car. You may want to choose Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this to try out different settings to get desired analysis results.

Travel time is an impedance; a car taking one minute to travel a mile along an empty road is an example of impedance.
Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20 minutes to walk the same mile-so it is important to
choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling. Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models
travel times for a car. These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Truck Time-Models travel
times for a truck.  These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Walk Time-Models travel

<p>GEO_LOCAL: The date-time values associated with the orders

values are based on the time zone in which the starting depot for the route is located. If a route does not have a starting depot,
all orders and depots across all the routes must be in a single time zone. For breaks, the date-time values are based on the time
zone of the routes. For example, if your depot is located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first time window
values (specified as TimeWindowStart1 and TimeWindowEnd1) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
eastern standard time.</p>
<p>UTC: The date-time values associated with the orders or depots are in the in coordinated universal time (UTC) and are not based on the time zone
in which the orders or depots are located. For example, if your depot is located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first
time window values (specified as TimeWindowStart1 and TimeWindowEnd1) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as 12:00 p.m.
and 9:00 p.m. eastern standard time assuming the eastern standard time is obeying the daylight saving time. Specifying the date-time values
in UTC is useful if you do not know the time zone in which the orders or depots are located or when you have orders and depots in multiple time
zones, and you want all the date-time values to start simultaneously. The UTC option is applicable only when your network dataset
defines a time zone attribute. Otherwise, all the date-time values are always treated as GEO_LOCAL.</p>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ID</span></code> - A unique identifier for the incident. The identifier is included in the output routes (as
the IncidentID field) and can help join additional information from the output routes, such as the
total travel time or total distance, to attributes from your incidents or vice versa. If the ID isn’t
specified, the service autogenerates a unique identifier for each incident.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AdditionalTime</span></code>-The amount
of time spent at the incident, which is added to the total time of the route. The units for this attribute
value are specified by the Measurement Units parameter. The attribute value is included in the analysis
only when the measurement units are time based. The default value is 0. If you are finding the closest
fire stations from fire incidents to estimate response times, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AdditionalTime</span></code> attribute can store the
amount of time it takes firefighters to hook up their equipment at the location of the incident before
they can begin fighting the fire.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AdditionalDistance</span></code>- The extra distance traveled at the incident, which
is added to the total distance of the route. The units for this attribute value are specified by the
Measurement Units parameter. The attribute value is included in the analysis only when the measurement
units are distance based. The default value is 0. Generally, the location of an incident, such as a home,
isn’t exactly on the streets; it is set back somewhat from the road. This attribute value can be used to
model the distance between the actual incident location and its location on the street, if it is important
to include that distance in the total travel distance.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code> - Specifies the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart from the incident.

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code> property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and
left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider an incident on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code> property was designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand
traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a facility on the left side
of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right
half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach a facility
from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example,

<p>Using one of the parameter values can find different

the travel direction and one-way restrictions. For instance, a
facility may be a 10-minute drive from the incident while traveling
from the incident to the facility, but while traveling from the
facility to the incident, it may be a 15-minute journey because of
different travel time in that direction. If you are setting a value for Time of Day, traffic may also cause the Facility to Incident and Incident to Facility options to return different results.</p>
<p>Fire departments commonly use the Facility to Incident
value for the parameter since they are concerned with the time it
takes to travel from the fire station (facility) to the location of
the emergency (incident). A retail store (facility) is more
concerned with the time it takes the shoppers (incidents) to reach

<li><p>Checked (True) - Use hierarchy when finding routes. When
hierarchy is used, the tool prefers higher-order streets (such as
freeways) to lower-order streets (such as local roads), and can be used
to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead
of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially
true when finding routes to faraway facilities, because drivers on long-distance
trips tend to prefer traveling on freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided.
Using hierarchy is computationally faster,
especially for long-distance routes, as the tool has to select the
best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.</p></li>
<li><p>Unchecked (False) - Do not use hierarchy when finding routes. If

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>restrictions</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes between
incidents and facilities. A restriction represents a driving preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions
cause roads to be prohibited, but they can also cause them to be avoided or preferred. For instance, using an Avoid
Toll Roads restriction will result in a route that will include toll roads only when it is absolutely required to
travel on toll roads in order to visit an incident or a facility. Height Restriction makes it possible to route
around any clearances that are lower than the height of your vehicle. If you are carrying corrosive materials on
your vehicle, using the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling the materials along roads where it is
marked as illegal to do so. Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.
Some restrictions require an additional value to be
specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work
with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
names appear under the AttributeName column in the Attribute
Parameter Values parameter. The ParameterValue field should be
specified in the Attribute Parameter Values parameter for the
restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.
Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in the list below.
Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether the restriction is available
in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section of the Data coverage for network analysis
services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select
availability in the region is supported in that country. If you specify restriction names that are not available in the
country where your incidents are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also ignores
restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value parameter).
It prohibits all restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>attribute_parameter_values</p></td>
<td><p>Optional FeatureSet. Specify additional values required by some restrictions, such as the weight of a vehicle for
Weight Restriction. You can also use the attribute parameter to specify whether any restriction prohibits, avoids,
or prefers travel on roads that use the restriction. If the restriction is
meant to avoid or prefer roads, you can further specify the degree
to which they are avoided or preferred using this
parameter. For example, you can choose to never use toll roads, avoid them as much as possible, or even highly prefer them.
The values you provide for this parameter are ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom.
If you specify the Attribute Parameter Values parameter from a
feature class, the field names on the feature class must match the fields as described below:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AttributeName</span></code>: Lists the name of the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code>: Lists the name of the parameter associated with the
restriction. A restriction can have one or more ParameterName field
values based on its intended use.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code>: The value for ParameterName used by the tool
when evaluating the restriction.</p>
<p>Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the
Restrictions parameter. The ParameterValue field is applicable only
if the restriction name is specified as the value for the
Restrictions parameter.</p>
<p>In Attribute Parameter Values, each
restriction (listed as AttributeName) has a ParameterName field
value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction
prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with
the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
preferred. The Restriction Usage ParameterName can be assigned any of
the following string values or their equivalent numeric values
listed within the parentheses:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>PROHIBITED (-1)-Travel on the roads using the restriction is completely
prohibited.</p>
<p>AVOID_HIGH (5) - It
is highly unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>AVOID_MEDIUM (2) - It
is unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are
associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>AVOID_LOW (1.3) - It
is somewhat unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>PREFER_LOW (0.8)  -It
is somewhat likely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>PREFER_MEDIUM (0.5) - It is likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that
are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>PREFER_HIGH (0.2) - It is highly likely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

<li><p>Straight Line - Return a straight line between the

</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When the Route Shape parameter is set to True Shape, the
generalization of the route shape can be further controlled using
the appropriate values for the Route Line Simplification Tolerance
parameters.</p>
<p>No matter which value you choose for the Route Shape
parameter, the best route is always determined by minimizing the
travel time or the travel distance, never using the straight-line
distance between incidents and
facilities. This means that only the route shapes are different,
not the underlying streets that are searched when finding the

Simplification maintains critical
points on a route, such as turns at intersections, to define the
essential shape of the route and removes other points. The

Travel distance in this sense is the same for all modes-a kilometer for a pedestrian is also a kilometer for a car.
(What may change is the pathways on which the different modes are allowed to travel, which affects distance between points,
and this is modeled by travel mode settings.) Travel time can also be an impedance; a car may take one minute to travel a mile
along an empty road. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20  minutes to walk the same mile,
so it is important to choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling.  Choose from the following impedance values:
Drive Time-Models travel times for a car. These travel times are dynamic and fluctuate according to traffic flows in areas where
traffic data is available. This is the default value. Truck Time-Models travel times for a truck.  These travel times are static for
each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian. Travel Distance-Stores  length measurements
along roads and paths. To model walk distance, choose this option and ensure Walking is  set in the Restriction parameter. Similarly,
to model drive or truck distance, choose Travel Distance here and set the appropriate restrictions so your vehicle travels only on
roads where it is permitted to do so. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which
is the default value. If you choose Drive Time, Truck Time, or Walk Time, the Measurement Units parameter must be set to a time-based
value; if you choose Travel Distance for Impedance, Measurement Units must be distance-based.</p>

<dd><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">solve_location_allocation</span></code> tool chooses the best location or locations from a set of input locations. Input to this tool includes facilities, 
which provide goods or services, and demand points, which consume the goods and services. The objective is to find the facilities that supply the 
demand points most efficiently. The tool solves this problem by analyzing various ways the demand points can be assigned to the different facilities. 
The solution is the scenario that allocates the most demand to facilities and minimizes overall travel. The output includes the solution facilities, 
demand points associated with their assigned facilities, and lines connecting demand points to their facilities. The location-allocation tool can be 
configured to solve specific problem types. Examples include the following: A retail store wants to see which potential store locations would need to 
be developed to capture 10 percent of the retail market in the area. A fire department wants to determine where it should locate fire stations to reach 
90 percent of the community within a four-minute response time. A police department wants to preposition personnel given past criminal activity at night. 
After a storm, a disaster response agency wants to find the best locations to set up triage facilities, with limited patient capacities, to tend to the 
affected population.</p>

specific to the Maximize Market Share and Target Market Share problem types; they are ignored in other problem types.
Weight-The relative weighting of the facility, which is used to rate the attractiveness, desirability, or bias of one
facility compared to another.  For example, a value of 2.0 could capture the preference of customers who prefer, at
a ratio of 2 to 1, shopping in one facility over another facility. Factors that potentially affect facility weight
include square footage, neighborhood, and age of the building. Weight values other than one are only honored by the

be allocated to a facility even if that demand is within the facility’s default measurement cutoff. Any value assigned to
the Capacity field overrides the Default Capacity parameter (Default_Capacity in Python) for the given facility.</p></li>

<td><p>Required FeatureSet. Specify one or more demand points (up to 10,000). The tool chooses the best facilities based in
large part on how they serve the demand points specified here.   When defining the demand points, you can set
properties for each one, such as the demand-point name or weight, by using attributes. Demand points can be specified
with the following fields: Name-The name of the demand point. The name is included in the name of an output allocation
line or lines if the demand point is part of the solution.  GroupName-The name of the group the demand point is part of.
This property is ignored for the maximize capacitated coverage, target market share, and maximize market share problem types.
If demand points share a group name, the solver allocates all members of the group to the same facility. (If constraints, such
as a cutoff distance, prevent any of the demand points in the group from reaching the same facility, none of the demand points
are allocated.) Weight-The relative weighting of the demand point. A value of 2.0 means the demand point is twice as important
as one with a weight of 1.0. If demand points represent households, weight could indicate the number of people in each household.
Cutoff_Time-The demand point can’t be allocated to a facility that is beyond the travel time indicated here. This field value
overrides the value of the Default Measurement Cutoff parameter.  The units for this attribute value are specified by the Measurement
Units parameter. The attribute value is referenced during the analysis only when the measurement units are time based. The default

<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Minimize</span> <span class="pre">Impedance</span></code>: This is also known as the P-Median problem type. Facilities are located such that the sum of all
weighted travel time or distance between demand points and solution facilities is minimized.
(Weighted travel is the amount of demand allocated to a facility multiplied by the travel distance or time to the facility.) This problem type is traditionally used to
locate warehouses, because it can reduce the overall transportation costs of delivering goods to outlets. Since Minimize Impedance reduces the overall distance the public
needs to travel to reach the chosen facilities, the minimize impedance problem without an impedance cutoff is ordinarily regarded as more equitable than other problem
types for locating some public-sector facilities such as libraries, regional airports, museums, department of motor vehicles offices, and health clinics.
The following list describes how the minimize impedance problem type handles demand:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>A demand point that cannot reach any facilities, due to setting a cutoff distance or time, is not allocated.</p></li>
<li><p>A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.</p></li>
<li><p>A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to the nearest facility only.</p></li>

</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Maximize</span> <span class="pre">Coverage</span></code>: Facilities are located such that as much demand as possible is allocated to solution facilities
within the impedance cutoff. Maximize Coverage is frequently used to locate fire stations, police stations, and ERS centers, because emergency services are often required to
arrive at all demand points within a specified response time. Note that it is important for all organizations, and critical for emergency services, to have accurate and precise data so that
analysis results correctly model real-world results. Pizza delivery businesses, as opposed to eat-in pizzerias, try to locate stores where they can cover the most people within a certain drive time.
People who order pizzas for delivery don’t typically worry about how far away the pizzeria is; they are mainly concerned with the pizza arriving within an advertised time window. Therefore, a
pizza-delivery business would subtract pizza-preparation time from their advertised delivery time and solve a maximize coverage problem to choose the candidate facility that would capture the most
potential customers in the coverage area. (Potential customers of eat-in pizzerias are more affected by distance, since they need to travel to the restaurant; thus, the attendance maximizing or
market share problem types would better suit eat-in restaurants.)
The following list describes how the Maximize Coverage problem handles demand:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to cutoff distance or time is not allocated.</p></li>
<li><p>A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.</p></li>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Maximize</span> <span class="pre">Capacitated</span> <span class="pre">Coverage</span></code>: Facilities are located such that all or the greatest amount of demand can be served without exceeding the capacity of any facility. Maximize
Capacitated Coverage behaves like  either the Minimize Impedance or Maximize Coverage problem type but with the added constraint of capacity. You can specify a capacity for an individual facility
by assigning a numeric value to  its corresponding Capacity field on the input facilities. If the Capacity field value is null, the facility is assigned a capacity from the Default Capacity property.
Use-cases for Maximize Capacitated Coverage include creating territories that encompass a given number of people or businesses, locating hospitals or other medical facilities with a limited number
of beds or patients who can be treated, or locating warehouses whose inventory isn’t assumed to be unlimited.
The following list describes how the Maximize Capacitated Coverage problem handles demand:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Unlike Maximize Coverage, Maximize Capacitated Coverage doesn’t require a value for the Default Measurement</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cutoff; however, when an cutoff is specified, any demand point outside the cutoff time or distance of all facilities is not allocated.
* An allocated demand point has all or none of its demand weight assigned to a facility; that is, demand isn’t apportioned with this problem type.
* If the total demand that can reach a facility is greater than the capacity of the facility, only the demand points that maximize
total captured demand and minimize total weighted travel are allocated.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You may notice an apparent inefficiency when a demand point is allocated to a facility that isn’t the  nearest solution facility. This may occur when demand points have varying weights and when the

solution for the entire problem required one or more local inefficiencies. In either case, the solution is correct.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Minimize</span> <span class="pre">Facilities</span></code>: Facilities are chosen such that as much weighted demand as
possible are allocated to solution facilities within the travel time or distance cutoff; additionally, the number of facilities required to cover demand is minimized. Minimize Facilities is the
same as Maximize Coverage but with the exception of the number of facilities to locate, which in this case is determined by the solver. When the cost of building facilities is not a limiting factor,
the same kinds of organizations that use Maximize Coverage (emergency response, for instance) use Minimize Facilities so that all possible demand points will be covered.
The following list describes how the Minimize Facilities problem handles demand:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated.</p></li>
<li><p>A demand point that can only  reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.</p></li>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Maximize</span> <span class="pre">Attendance</span></code>: Facilities are chosen such that as much demand weight as possible is allocated to facilities while
assuming the demand weight decreases in relation to the distance between the facility and the demand point. Specialty stores
that have little or no competition benefit from this problem type, but it may also be beneficial to general retailers and restaurants that
don’t have the data on competitors necessary to perform market share problem types. Some businesses that might benefit from this problem
type include coffee shops, fitness centers, dental and medical offices, and electronics stores. Public transit bus stops are often
chosen with the help of Maximize Attendance. Maximize Attendance assumes that the farther people have to travel to reach your facility,
the less likely they are to use it. This is reflected in how the amount of demand allocated to facilities diminishes with distance.
The following list describes how the Maximize Attendance problem handles demand:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated.</p></li>
<li><p>When a demand point can reach a facility, its demand weight is only partially allocated to the facility.

<li><p>The weight of a demand point that can reach more than one facility is proportionately allocated to the nearest facility only.</p></li>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Maximize</span> <span class="pre">Market</span> <span class="pre">Share</span></code>: A specific number of facilities are chosen such that the allocated demand is maximized in the presence
of competitors. The goal is to capture as much of the total market share as possible with a given number of facilities,
which you specify. The total market share is the sum of all demand weight for valid demand points. The market share problem
types require the most data because, along with knowing your own facilities’ weight,
you also need to know that of your competitors’ facilities. The same types of facilities that use the Maximize Attendance problem type
can also use market share problem types given that they have comprehensive
information that includes competitor data. Large discount stores typically use  Maximize Market Share to locate a finite set of new stores.
The market share problem types use a Huff model, which is also known as a gravity model or spatial interaction.
The following list describes how the Maximize Market Share problem handles demand:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated.</p></li>
<li><p>A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.</p></li>
<li><p>A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to them; furthermore, the weight is
split among the facilities proportionally to the facilities’ attractiveness (facility weight) and inversely proportional to
the distance between the facility and demand point. Given equal facility weights,
this means more demand weight is assigned to near facilities than far facilities.</p></li>
<li><p>The total market share, which can be used to calculate the captured market share, is the sum of the weight of all valid demand points.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Target</span> <span class="pre">Market</span> <span class="pre">Share</span></code>: Target Market Share chooses the minimum number of facilities necessary to capture a specific percentage
of the total market share in the presence of competitors. The total market share is the
sum of all demand weight for valid demand points. You set the percent of the market share you want to reach and let the solver choose
the fewest number of facilities necessary to meet that threshold.
The market share problem types require the most data because, along with knowing your own facilities’ weight, you also need to know
that of your competitors’ facilities. The same types of facilities that use
the Maximize Attendance problem type can also use market share problem types given that they have comprehensive information that includes
competitor data. Large discount stores typically use the Target Market Share
problem type when they want to know how much expansion would be required to reach a certain level of the market share or see what strategy would be needed just to maintain their current market share given the introduction
of new competing facilities. The results often represent what stores would like to do if budgets weren’t a concern. In other cases where budget is a concern, stores revert to the Maximize Market Share problem and
simply capture as much of the market share as possible with a limited number of facilities.
The following list describes how the target market share problem handles demand:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The total market share, which is used in calculating the captured market share, is the sum of the weight of all valid demand points.</p></li>
<li><p>A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated.</p></li>
<li><p>A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.</p></li>
<li><p>A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to them; furthermore,
the weight is split among the facilities proportionally to the facilities’ attractiveness (facility weight) and inversely

weight is assigned to near facilities than far facilities.</p></li>

between two locations. So impedancedf is the shortest-path (time or distance) between demand point d and facility f,

<p>Travel times and distances may change based on direction of travel. If going from point A to point B,
you may encounter less traffic or have a shorter path, due to one-way streets and turn restrictions,
than if you were traveling in the opposite direction. For instance, going from point A to point B may
only take 10 minutes, but going the other direction may take 15 minutes. These differing measurements may
affect whether demand points can be assigned to certain facilities because of cutoffs or, in problem types
where demand is apportioned, affect how much demand is captured. Fire departments commonly measure from
facilities to demand points since they are concerned with the time it takes to travel from the fire station
to the location of the emergency. A retail store is more concerned with the time it takes shoppers to reach
the store; therefore, stores commonly measure from demand points to facilities. Travel Direction also
determines the meaning of any start time that is provided. See the Time of Day parameter for more information.</p>

Traffic constantly changes in reality, and as it changes, travel times between facilities and demand points
also fluctuate. Therefore, indicating different time and date values over several analyses may affect how
demand is allocated to facilities and which facilities are chosen in the results.  The time of day always
indicates a start time. However, travel may start from facilities or demand points; it depends on what you

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>use_hierarchy</p></td>
<td><p>Optional boolean. Specify whether hierarchy should be used when finding the shortest path between the
facilities and demand points. Checked (True):
Use hierarchy when measuring between facilities and demand points. When
hierarchy is used, the tool prefers higher-order streets (such as
freeways) to lower-order streets (such as local roads), and can be used
to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead
of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially
true when finding routes to faraway locations, because drivers on long-distance trips tend to prefer traveling on freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided. Using hierarchy is computationally faster,
especially for long-distance routes, since the tool can determine the
best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.
Unchecked (False):
Do not use hierarchy when measuring between facilities and demand points. If
hierarchy is not used, the tool considers all the streets and doesn’t
prefer higher-order streets when finding the route. This is often
used when finding short-distance routes within a city.

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>restrictions</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes
between facilities and demand points. A restriction represents a driving
preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads
to be prohibited. For instance, using an Avoid Toll Roads restriction will result in a route that will
include toll roads only when it is absolutely required to travel on toll roads in order to visit an incident
or a facility. Height Restriction makes it possible to route around any clearances that are lower than the
height of your vehicle. If you are carrying corrosive materials on your vehicle, using the Any Hazmat Prohibited
restriction prevents hauling the materials along roads where it is marked as illegal to do so.
Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.
Some restrictions require an additional value to be
specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work
with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
names appear under the AttributeName column in the Attribute
Parameter Values parameter. The ParameterValue field should be
specified in the Attribute Parameter Values parameter for the
restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.
Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in the list below.
Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether the restriction is available
in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section of the Data coverage for network analysis services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select availability in the region is supported in that country. If you specify restriction names that are not available in the country where your incidents are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also ignores restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value parameter). It prohibits all restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.
The service supports the restriction names listed in the following table:</p>

In Attribute Parameter Values, each restriction (listed as AttributeName) has a ParameterName field
value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction
prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with
the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
preferred. The Restriction Usage ParameterName can be assigned any of
the following string values or their equivalent numeric values
listed within the parentheses:</p>

<p>In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

<p>Specify the type of line features that are output by the

values:
Straight Line: Return straight lines between solution facilities and the demand points allocated to them. This is the default.  Drawing straight lines on a map helps you visualize how demand is allocated. None: Return a table containing data about the shortest paths between solution facilities and the demand points allocated to them, but don’t return lines.
No matter which value you choose for the Allocation Line Shape
parameter, the shortest route is always determined by minimizing the
travel time or the travel distance, never using the straight-line

<p>To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the GetTravelModes tool from the Utilities toolbox available under the same GIS Server connection
you used to access the tool. The GetTravelModes tool adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the

<p>The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values,  and Impedance).
The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model travelling by car. You may want to choose Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this to try out different settings to get desired analysis results.

Travel time is an impedance; a car taking one minute to travel a mile along an empty road is an example of impedance. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20 minutes to walk the same mile-so it is important to choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling. Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models travel times for a car. These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Truck Time-Models travel times for a truck.  These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian.

<dd><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">generate_origin_destination_cost_matrix</span></code> tool creates an origin-destination (OD) cost matrix from multiple origins to multiple destinations. 
An OD cost matrix is a table that contains the travel time and travel distance from each origin to each destination. Additionally, it ranks the 
destinations that each origin connects to in ascending order based on the minimum time or distance required to travel from that origin to each 
destination. The best path on the street network is discovered for each origin-destination pair, and the travel times and travel distances are 
stored as attributes of the output lines. Even though the lines are straight for performance reasons, they always store the travel time and travel 
distance along the street network, not straight-line distance.</p>

Checked (True): Use hierarchy when finding routes. When hierarchy is used, the tool prefers higher-order  streets (such as
freeways) to lower-order streets (such as local roads), and can be used
to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead
of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially
true when finding routes to faraway locations, because drivers on long-distance trips tend to prefer traveling on
freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided. Using hierarchy is computationally faster,
especially for long-distance routes, since the tool can determine the
best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.
Unchecked (False):
Do not use hierarchy when finding routes. If
hierarchy is not used, the tool considers all the streets and doesn’t
prefer higher-order streets when finding the route. This is often
used when finding short routes within a city.</p>
<p>The tool automatically reverts to using hierarchy if the
straight-line distance between facilities and demand points is
greater than 50 miles (80.46
kilometers), even if you have set this parameter to not use hierarchy.
This parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom. When modeling a custom walking mode,
it is recommended to turn off hierarchy since the hierarchy is designed for motorized vehicles.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>restrictions</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes.
A restriction represents a driving preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads to be
prohibited, but they can also cause them to be avoided or preferred. For instance, using an Avoid Toll Roads
restriction will result in a route that will include toll roads only when it is absolutely required to travel
on toll roads in order to visit a stop. Height Restriction makes it possible to route around any clearances
that are lower than the height of your vehicle. If you are carrying corrosive materials on your vehicle,
using the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling the materials along roads where it is marked
as illegal to do so. The values you provide for this parameter are ignored unless Travel Mode is set to
Custom. Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.
Some restrictions require an additional value to be specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
names appear under the AttributeName column in the Attribute
Parameter Values parameter. The ParameterValue field should be
specified in the Attribute Parameter Values parameter for the
restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.
Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in the list below.
Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether the restriction is available
in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section of the Data coverage for network analysis
services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select
availability in the region is supported in that country. If you specify restriction names that are not available
in the country where your incidents are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also
ignores restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value
parameter). It prohibits all restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.</p>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>attribute_parameter_values</p></td>
<td><p>Optional FeatureSet. Specify additional values required by some restrictions, such as the weight of a vehicle
for Weight Restriction. You can also use the attribute parameter to specify whether any restriction prohibits,
avoids, or prefers travel on roads that use the restriction. If the restriction is
meant to avoid or prefer roads, you can further specify the degree
to which they are avoided or preferred using this
parameter. For example, you can choose to never use toll roads, avoid them as much as possible, or even highly
prefer them.
The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value.
If you specify the Attribute Parameter Values parameter from a feature class, the field names on the feature class must match the fields as described below:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AttributeName</span></code>: Lists the name of the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code>: Lists the name of the parameter associated with the restriction. A restriction can have one or more ParameterName field

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code>: The value for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code> used by the tool when evaluating the restriction.
Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the Restrictions parameter. The ParameterValue field is applicable only
if the restriction name is specified as the value for the
Restrictions parameter.
In Attribute Parameter Values, each restriction (listed as AttributeName) has a ParameterName field
value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction
prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with
the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
preferred. The Restriction Usage ParameterName can be assigned any of
the following string values or their equivalent numeric values
listed within the parentheses:</p>

<p>In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>impedance</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string.  Specify the impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost of traveling along
road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.
Travel distance is an impedance; the length of a road in kilometers can be thought of as impedance. Travel distance
in this sense is the same for all modes-a kilometer for a pedestrian is also a kilometer for a car. (What may change
is the pathways on which the different modes are allowed to travel, which affects distance between points, and this
is modeled by travel mode settings.) Travel time can also be an impedance; a car may take one minute to travel a
mile along an empty road. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20  minutes to walk
the same mile, so it is important to choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling.
Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models travel times for a car. These travel times are
dynamic and fluctuate according to traffic flows in areas where traffic data is available. Truck Time-Models
travel times for a truck.  These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. This is
the default value. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian. Travel Distance-Stores  length measurements
along roads and paths. To model walk distance, choose this option and ensure Walking is  set in the Restriction
parameter. Similarly, to model drive or truck distance, choose Travel Distance here and set the appropriate
restrictions so your vehicle travels only on roads where it is permitted to do so. The value you provide for this
parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom. If you choose Drive Time, Truck Time, or Walk Time, the
Measurement Units parameter must be set to a time-based value; if you choose Travel Distance for Impedance,
Measurement Units must be distance-based.</p>

capable of finding routes that visit several input stops in a sequence
you predetermine or in the  sequence that minimizes overall travel. You
can group the input stops into different routes using the RouteName

<td><p>Required FeatureSet. Specify the locations you want the output route
or routes to visit. You can add up to 10,000 stops and assign up to 150 stops to a single
route. (Assign stops to routes using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code> attribute). When specifying the stops,
you can set properties for each one, such as its name or service time, by using
attributes.
The stops can be specified with the following attributes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Name</span></code>: The name of the stop. This name is used when generating driving directions.
It is common to pass the name of a business, person, or street address at the stop.
If a value is not specified, an automatically generated name such as Location 1 or
Location 2 is assigned to each stop.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart</span></code>: The earliest time the stop can be visited. Specify this attribute if you want to limit when
a route can arrive at a stop; for instance, you may want to make deliveries to a restaurant between
busy lunch and dinner hours (for example, sometime between 2:00 and 4:30 p.m.) to facilitate the work
for you and the restaurant staff.</p>
<p>The value is specified as an integer that represents the number of milliseconds since epoch (January 1, 1970).</p>
<p>This value can be specified either in UTC or local time, depending on the value given for
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">timeWindowsAreUTC</span></code> parameter.</p>
<p>If you specify this attribute, you also need to specify the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code> attribute.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code>: The latest time the stop can be visited. Together, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code>
attributes make up the time window within which a route can visit the stop. As with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart</span></code>,
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code> value is specified as an integer that represents the number of milliseconds since
epoch (January 1, 1970) and is interpreted as UTC or local time, depending on the value specified for
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">timeWindowsAreUTC</span></code> parameter.</p>
<p>The time window specified using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code> attributes is not considered a hard
constraint by the service. That is, the service doesn’t fail if the stop cannot be visited during the time
window; instead, the service tries to find a route that visits the stop during its time window, but if time
window violations are inevitable, the service tries to find a solution that minimizes the time-window violation
time for all stops in the problem.</p>
<p>If a route has to arrive early at the stop, a wait time is added to the total travel time of the route.
Similarly, if the route arrives late at the stop, a violation time is added to the total travel time of
the route. For example, If the time window on the stop is set as 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM and the earliest a
route can reach the stop is 11:25 AM, a violation of 25 minutes is added to the total travel time.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code>: The name of the route to which the stop belongs. Use this attribute to group stops into different
routes and, therefore, solve multiple routes in a single request. For example, if you want to find two distinct
routes - a route with 4 stops and another with 6 stops - set RouteName to Route1 for each of the four stops and Route2
for each of the 6 stops. The service will produce two distinct routes and driving directions for each group of
stops in a single request.</p>
<p>If <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code> is not specified for any stops, all stops belong to the same route. If <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code> is not
specified for some stops, those stops are treated as unassigned and are not included in any route.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sequence</span></code>: The output routes will visit the stops in the order you specify with this
attribute. Within a group of stops that have the same RouteName value, the sequence
number should be greater than 0 but not greater than the total number of stops. Also, the
sequence number should not be duplicated. If Reorder Stops To Find Optimal Routes is
checked (True), all but possibly the first and last sequence values for each route name
are ignored so the tool can find the sequence that minimizes overall travel for each
route. (The settings for Preserve Ordering of Stops and Return to Start determine whether
the first or last sequence values for each route are ignored.)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code>: Specify the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart from the stop. One of the
integers listed in the Coded value column in the following table must be specified as a value of this
attribute. The values in the Setting column are the descriptive names for the CurbApproach attribute
values that you may have come across when using ArcGIS Network Analyst extension extension software.</p>

The vehicle can approach and depart the stop in either direction,

can be chosen if it is possible and desirable for your vehicle to turn
around at the stop. This decision may depend on the width of the road and
the amount of traffic or whether the stop has a parking lot where vehicles
can pull in and turn around.</p></td>

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code> property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand
traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a stop on the left side of a vehicle.
It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What
may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach from the right or left side. For example,
if you want to arrive at a stop and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the stop, you would choose
Right side of vehicle in the United States but Left side of vehicle in the United Kingdom.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Attr_TravelTime</span></code>: Specify the amount of time for cars, in minutes, that will be spent at the stop when
the route visits it. This attribute can be used to model the time required to provide some kind of service
while you are at the stop. It can also be used to specify some additional time required to reach the actual
location on the street from where the route starts or time required to reach the actual destination location
from the location on the street where the route ends. The value for this attribute is included in the total
travel time for the route and is also displayed in driving directions as service time. A zero or null value
indicates that the stop requires no service time.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you are finding the best route through three stops. Suppose it requires 2 minutes to
walk to the street location from where the route starts, you need to spend 10 minutes at Stop 2, and it takes 5
minutes to walk from the street location to the destination. The Attr_TravelTime attribute should be given
values of 2, 10, and 5 for Stop 1, Stop 2, and Stop 3, respectively. If it takes 10 minutes to travel from Stop
1 to Stop 2 and 10 minutes to travel from Stop 2 to Stop 3, the total travel time to reach Stop 3 is displayed
as 37 minutes (2 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 5), even though there is only 20 minutes of traveling to reach Stop 3.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Attr_TruckTravelTime</span></code>: Specify the amount of time for trucks, in minutes, that will be added to the total
travel time of the route at the stop. The attribute value can be used to model the time spent at the stop.</p>
<p>The value for this attribute is included in the total travel time for the route and is also displayed in
driving directions as service time. A zero or null value indicates that the incident requires no service time.
The default value is 0.</p>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Attr_WalkTime</span></code>: Specify the amount of time for pedestrians, in minutes, that will be added to the total
travel time of the route at the stop. The attribute value can be used to model the time spent at the incident.
The value for this attribute is included in the total travel time for the route and is also displayed in
driving directions as service time. A zero or null value indicates that the incident requires no service time.
The default value is 0.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Attr_Miles</span></code>: Specify the distance in miles that will be added when calculating total distance of the route.
Generally the locations of the stops are not exactly on the streets but are set back somewhat from the road.
The Attr_Miles attribute can be used to model the distance between the actual stop location and its location
on the street if it is important to include that distance in the total travel distance.</p></li>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FullEdge</span></code>: Specify how the restriction point barriers are applied to the edge elements
during the analysis. The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the
numeric code, not the name in parentheses):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 (False): Permits travel on the edge up to the barrier, but not through it. This is the default value.</p></li>
<li><p>1 (True): Restricts travel anywhere on the associated edge.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code>: Specifies the direction of traffic that is affected by the barrier.
The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code,
not the name in parentheses):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 (Either side of vehicle): The barrier affects travel over the edge in both directions.</p></li>
<li><p>1 (Right side of vehicle): Vehicles are only affected if the barrier is on their right
side during the approach. Vehicles that traverse the same edge but approach the barrier
on their left side are not affected by the barrier.</p></li>
<li><p>2 (Left side of vehicle): Vehicles are only affected if the barrier is on their left side
during the approach. Vehicles that traverse the same edge but approach the barrier on their
right side are not affected by the barrier.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Since junctions are points and don’t have a side, barriers on junctions affect all vehicles
regardless of the curb approach.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code> property was designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards:
right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a
facility on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether
the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving
standards is your decision to approach a facility from one of two directions, that is, so it
ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at a facility
and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the facility, you would choose Right side of
vehicle (1) in the United States but Left side of vehicle (2) in the United Kingdom.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bearing</span></code>: The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and are measured clockwise
from true north. This field is used in conjunction with the BearingTol field.</p>
<p>Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile device equipped with a GPS receiver.
Try to include bearing data if you are loading an input location that is moving, such as a pedestrian or a vehicle.</p>
<p>Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle
is near an intersection or an overpass for example. Bearing also helps the tool determine on which side
of the street the point is.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BearingTol</span></code>: The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable bearing values when locating moving
points on an edge using the Bearing field. If the value from the Bearing field is within the range of acceptable
values that are generated from the bearing tolerance on an edge, the point can be added as a network location
there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is evaluated.</p>
<p>The units are in degrees, and the default value is 30. Values must be greater than 0 and less than 180.
A value of 30 means that when ArcGIS Network Analyst extension attempts to add a network location on an edge,
a range of acceptable bearing values is generated 15 degrees to either side of the edge (left and right) and
in both digitized directions of the edge.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NavLatency</span></code>: This field is only used in the solve process if Bearing and BearingTol also have values;
however, entering a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NavLatency</span></code> value is optional, even when values are present in Bearing and BearingTol.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NavLatency</span></code> indicates how much time is expected to elapse from the moment GPS information is sent from a
moving vehicle to a server and the moment the processed route is received by the vehicle’s navigation device.</p>
<p>The time units of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NavLatency</span></code> are the same as the units specified by the timeUnits property of the analysis object.</p>

several roads from being traversed, thereby channeling possible
routes away from undesirable parts of the street
network.</p>
<p>The tool imposes a limit on the number of streets you can

<li><p>1 (Scaled Cost)-Scales the time or distance required to travel the
underlying streets by a factor specified using the ScaledTimeFactor

covered by the barrier, the travel time or distance is apportioned
and then scaled. For example, a factor 0.25 would mean that travel
on underlying streets is expected to be four times faster than
normal. A factor of 3.0 would mean it is expected to take three
times longer than normal to travel on underlying streets. This
barrier type is referred to as a scaled-cost polygon barrier. It

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>use_hierarchy</p></td>
<td><p>Optional boolean. Specify whether hierarchy should be used when finding the best routes.</p>
<p>Checked (True) - Use hierarchy when finding routes. When
hierarchy is used, the tool prefers higher-order streets, such as
freeways, to lower-order streets, such as local roads, and can be used
to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead
of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially
true when finding routes to faraway locations, because drivers on long-distance trips tend to prefer traveling on freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided. Using hierarchy is computationally faster,
especially for long-distance routes, as the tool has to select the
best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.</p>
<p>Unchecked (False) - Do not use hierarchy when finding routes. If
hierarchy is not used, the tool considers all the streets and doesn’t
prefer higher-order streets when finding the route. This is often
used when finding short-distance routes within a city.</p>

<td><p>Optional string. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes.  The value you provide for this parameter
is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value. A restriction represents a driving
preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads
to be prohibited. For instance, using an Avoid Toll Roads restriction will result in a route that will include
roads only when it is absolutely required to travel on toll roads in order to visit an incident or a facility.
Height Restriction makes it possible to route around any clearances that are lower than the height of your vehicle.
If you are carrying corrosive materials on your vehicle, using the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling
the materials along roads where it is marked as illegal to do so.</p>
<p>Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.
Some restrictions require an additional value to be
specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work
with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
names appear under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AttributeName</span></code> column in the Attribute
Parameter Values parameter. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code> field should be
specified in the Attribute Parameter Values parameter for the
restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.</p>
<p>Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in the list below.
Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether the restriction is available
in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section of the Data coverage for network analysis
services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select
availability in the region is supported in that country. If you specify restriction names that are not available in
the country where your incidents are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also ignores
restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value parameter).
It prohibits all restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.</p>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code>: The value for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code> used by the tool when evaluating the restriction.</p>
<p>Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the Restrictions parameter. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code> field is applicable only
if the restriction name is specified as the value for the
Restrictions parameter.</p>
<p>In Attribute Parameter Values, each restriction (listed as <cite>AttributeName</cite>) has a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code> field
value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction
prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with

</div></blockquote>
<p>In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

travel time or the travel distance, never using the straight-line
distance between incidents and

Simplification maintains critical
points on a route, such as turns at intersections, to define the
essential shape of the route and removes other points. The
simplification distance you specify is the maximum allowable offset
that the simplified line can deviate from the original line.
Simplifying a line reduces the number of vertices that are part of
the route geometry. This improves the tool execution

<p>To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GetTravelModes</span></code> tool from the Utilities toolbox available under the same GIS Server connection
you used to access the tool. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GetTravelModes</span></code> tool adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the
tool does not have to lookup the settings based on the travel mode name.</p>
<p>The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values,  and Impedance).
The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model travelling by car. You may want to choose Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this to try out different settings to get desired analysis results.

Travel time is an impedance; a car taking one minute to travel a mile along an empty road is an example of impedance.
Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20 minutes to walk the same mile-so it is important to
choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling. Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models
travel times for a car. These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Truck Time-Models travel

values are based on the time zone in which the starting depot for the route is located. If a route does not have a starting depot,
all orders and depots across all the routes must be in a single time zone. For breaks, the date-time values are based on the time
zone of the routes. For example, if your depot is located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first time window
values (specified as TimeWindowStart1 and TimeWindowEnd1) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
eastern standard time.</p>
<p>UTC: The date-time values associated with the orders or depots are in the in coordinated universal time (UTC) and are not based on the time zone
in which the orders or depots are located. For example, if your depot is located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first
time window values (specified as TimeWindowStart1 and TimeWindowEnd1) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as 12:00 p.m.
and 9:00 p.m. eastern standard time assuming the eastern standard time is obeying the daylight saving time. Specifying the date-time values
in UTC is useful if you do not know the time zone in which the orders or depots are located or when you have orders and depots in multiple time
zones, and you want all the date-time values to start simultaneously. The UTC option is applicable only when your network dataset
defines a time zone attribute. Otherwise, all the date-time values are always treated as GEO_LOCAL.</p>

<p>This <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">generate_service_areas</span></code> tool determines network service areas around facilities. A network service area is a region that
encompasses all streets that can be accessed within a given distance or travel time from one or more facilities. For instance, the
10-minute service area for a facility includes all the streets that can be reached within 10 minutes from that facility. Service areas
are commonly used to visualize and measure accessibility. For example, a three-minute drive-time polygon around a grocery store can
determine which residents are able to reach the store within three minutes and are thus more likely to shop there.</p>

<p>Checked (True) - Use the hierarchy attribute for the analysis. Using a hierarchy results in the
solver preferring higher-order edges to lower-order edges. Hierarchical solves are faster, and
they can be used to simulate the preference of a driver who chooses to travel on freeways over
local roads when possible-even if that means a longer trip.</p>

quickly fence off several roads from being traversed, thereby channeling possible routes away
from undesirable parts of the street network.</p>
<p>The tool imposes a limit on the number of streets you can

on underlying streets is expected to be four times faster than
normal. A factor of 3.0 would mean it is expected to take three
times longer than normal to travel on underlying streets. This

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>restrictions</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes
between facilities and demand points. A restriction represents a driving
preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads
to be prohibited. For instance, using an Avoid Toll Roads restriction will result in a route that will
include toll roads only when it is absolutely required to travel on toll roads in order to visit an
incident or a facility. Height Restriction makes it possible to route around any clearances that are
lower than the height of your vehicle. If you are carrying corrosive materials on your vehicle, using
the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling the materials along roads where it is marked as
illegal to do so.
Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.
Some restrictions require an additional value to be
specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work
with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
names appear under the AttributeName column in the Attribute
Parameter Values parameter. The ParameterValue field should be
specified in the Attribute Parameter Values parameter for the
restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.
Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in
the list below. Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether
the restriction is available in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section
of the Data coverage for network analysis services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the
Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select availability in the region is supported in that country.
If you specify restriction names that are not available in the country where your incidents are located,
the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also ignores restrictions whose Restriction Usage
parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value parameter). It prohibits all restrictions
whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.

restriction. If the restriction is meant to avoid or prefer roads, you can further specify the degree
to which they are avoided or preferred using this parameter. For example, you can choose to never use
toll roads, avoid them as much as possible, or even highly prefer them.</p>
<p>The values you provide for this parameter are ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom. If you specify
the Attribute Parameter Values parameter from a  feature class, the field names on the feature class must
match the fields as described below:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AttributeName</span></code>: Lists the name of the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code>: Lists the name of the parameter associated with the
restriction. A restriction can have one or more ParameterName field
values based on its intended use.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code>: The value for ParameterName used by the tool
when evaluating the restriction.</p>
<p>Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the Restrictions parameter. The ParameterValue field is
applicable only if the restriction name is specified as the value for the Restrictions parameter.</p>
<p>In Attribute Parameter Values, each restriction (listed as AttributeName) has a ParameterName field
value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel
on the roads associated with the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
preferred. The Restriction Usage ParameterName can be assigned any of the following string values or
their equivalent numeric values listed within the parentheses:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>PROHIBITED (-1) - Travel on the roads using the restriction is completely
prohibited.</p>
<p>AVOID_HIGH (5) - It
is highly unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>AVOID_MEDIUM (2) - It
is unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are
associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>AVOID_LOW (1.3) - It
is somewhat unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>PREFER_LOW (0.8) - It
is somewhat likely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>PREFER_MEDIUM (0.5) - It is likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that
are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>PREFER_HIGH (0.2) - It is highly likely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED, for the Restriction Usage if the restriction
is dependent on a vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some cases, the value for
Restriction Usage depends on your routing preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction
has the default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter. This means that when the
restriction is used, the tool will try to route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best route; it has a medium priority. Choosing
AVOID_LOW would put lower importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would give it a higher
importance and thus make it more acceptable for the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls.
Choosing PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it impossible for a route to
travel on any portion of a toll road. Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast, others prefer to drive on toll roads
because avoiding traffic is more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter case, you
would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the
preference, the farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads associated with the
restriction.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>time_zone_for_time_of_day</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specifies the time zone or zones of the Time of Day
parameter.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Geographically</span> <span class="pre">Local</span></code>: The Time of Day parameter refers to the time zone or zones in which the facilities
are located. Therefore, the start or end times of the service areas are staggered by time zone. Setting
Time of Day to 9:00 a.m., choosing geographically local for Time Zone for Time of Day, and solving causes
service areas to be generated for 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time for any facilities in the Eastern Time Zone,
9:00 a.m. Central Time for facilities in the Central Time Zone, 9:00 a.m. Mountain Time for facilities in
the Mountain Time Zone, and so on, for facilities in different time zones. If stores in a chain that span
the U.S. open at 9:00 a.m. local time, this parameter value could be chosen to find market territories at
opening time for all stores in one solve. First, the stores in the Eastern Time Zone open and a polygon is
generated, then an hour later stores open in Central Time, and so on. Nine o’clock is always in local time
but staggered in real time.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UTC</span></code>: The Time of Day parameter refers to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
Therefore, all facilities are reached or departed from simultaneously, regardless of the time zone each is
in. Setting Time of Day to 2:00 p.m., choosing UTC, then solving causes service areas to be generated for
9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time for any facilities in the Eastern Time Zone, 8:00 a.m. Central Standard
Time for facilities in the Central Time Zone, 7:00 a.m. Mountain Standard Time for facilities in the
Mountain Time Zone, and so on, for facilities in different time zones. The scenario above assumes standard
time. During daylight saving time, the Eastern, Central, and Mountain Times would each be one hour ahead
(that is, 10:00, 9:00, and 8:00 a.m., respectively). One of the cases in which the UTC option is useful is
to visualize emergency-response coverage for a jurisdiction that is split into two time zones. The emergency
vehicles are loaded as facilities. Time of Day is set to now in UTC. (You need to determine what  the current
time and date are  in terms of UTC to correctly use this option.) Other properties are set and the analysis
is solved. Even though a time-zone boundary divides the vehicles, the results show areas that can be reached
given current traffic conditions. This same process  can be used for other times as well, not just for now.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Irrespective of the Time Zone for Time of Day setting, all facilities must be in the same time zone
when Time of Day has a nonnull value and Polygons for Multiple Facilities is set to create merged or
nonoverlapping polygons.</p>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>travel_mode</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string.  Specify the mode of transportation to model in the analysis. Travel
modes are managed in ArcGIS Online and can be configured by the administrator of your organization to better
reflect your organization’s workflows. You need to specify the name of a travel mode supported by your
organization.</p>
<p>To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the GetTravelModes tool from the Utilities toolbox
available under the same GIS Server connection you used to access the tool. The GetTravelModes tool
adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode
Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the tool does not have to lookup the settings
based on the travel mode name.</p>
<p>The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode
parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values,  and Impedance).
The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model travelling by car. You may want to choose
Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this
to try out different settings to get desired analysis results. Once you have identified the analysis settings,
you should work with your organization’s administrator and save these settings as part of new or existing
travel mode so that everyone in your organization can rerun the analysis with the same settings.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>impedance</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify the impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost
of traveling along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.
Travel distance is an impedance; the length of a road in kilometers can be thought of as impedance. Travel
distance in this sense is the same for all modes-a kilometer for a pedestrian is also a kilometer for a car.
(What may change is the pathways on which the different modes are allowed to travel, which affects distance
between points, and this is modeled by travel mode settings.) Travel time can also be an impedance; a car
may take one minute to travel a mile along an empty road. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian
may take more than 20  minutes to walk the same mile, so it is important to choose the right impedance for
the travel mode you are modeling.  Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models travel times
for a car. These travel times are dynamic and fluctuate according to traffic flows in areas where traffic data
is available. This is the default value. Truck Time-Models travel times for a truck.  These travel times are
static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian. Travel
Distance-Stores  length measurements along roads and paths. To model walk distance, choose this option and
ensure Walking is  set in the Restriction parameter. Similarly, to model drive or truck distance, choose Travel
Distance here and set the appropriate restrictions so your vehicle travels only on roads where it is permitted
to do so. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the
default value. If you choose Drive Time, Truck Time, or Walk Time, the Measurement Units parameter must be set
to a time-based value; if you choose Travel Distance for Impedance, Measurement Units must be distance-based.</p>

the location of the file can be determined by accessing the Copy Location option in the shortcut menu on the Output Network
Analysis Layer parameter in the entry corresponding to the tool execution in the Geoprocessing Results window.

of the following form {“overrideSetting1” : “value1”, “overrideSetting2” :
“value2”}. The override setting name is always enclosed in double quotes. The values can be a number, Boolean,
or string. The default value for this parameter is no value, which indicates not to override any solver settings. Overrides
